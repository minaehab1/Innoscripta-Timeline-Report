# Overview — United States Version

## 1. What They Do

Innoscripta digitizes the **R&D funding and compliance lifecycle** through its cloud platform **Clusterix**.

- Single platform for R&D planning, documentation, time tracking, cost allocation, and audit-ready reporting.
- Country rules are modular, enabling high-accuracy configuration for **US federal and state R&D credits**.
- Positioned as the **operational system of record for innovation funding**, replacing spreadsheet-based and manual consultant workflows.

## 2. Problems They Solve

US companies struggle to claim the **Section 41 R&D tax credit** and state credits efficiently and defensibly.

- Documentation is fragmented across project tools, HR systems, spreadsheets, and emails.
- Linking technical narratives to the IRS **four-part test** and to **Form 6765** is labor-intensive.
- Exam readiness requires evidence at the “**business component**” level, not just summary narratives.
- Consulting-only models often produce one-time reports that lack daily operational traceability.

---

## 3. How Their Solution Works

Clusterix becomes the **daily evidence engine for qualifying R&D work**.

- R&D projects are tagged to business components (product / process / software).
- Experiments, alternatives, test results, and uncertainty are logged as part of normal workflows.
- Time and payroll are mapped directly into **qualified research expenditures (QREs)**.
- Outputs convert into submission-ready packages for **IRS Form 6765** and state-credit workpapers.
