I want you to create a timeline presentation page, which is basically using the design kit of Innoscripta. I will provide you all the links, so each item should be clickable with the link associated to it. Basically, it will say what I did in the month of November, what I did in the month of December, what I'm currently working on, and maybe the pending upcoming tasks. It's visually appealing and can be presented to the founder and the CEO and the decision makers. make it user-friendly as well, so it's not that complicated.
