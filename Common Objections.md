Below are the **top 10 most likely objections in the order your B2B ICP will think them — chronologically during the buying journey**.
Each includes: **why they feel that way → belief to shift → 45–60 sec breakout video script**.

---

## **1️⃣ “This sounds great… but are we even eligible?”**

**Why they feel that way:**
Founders aren’t 100% sure whether what they build “counts as R&D” and don’t want to waste time exploring something that isn’t for them. 

**Belief to shift:**
*Eligibility is broader than people think — and most tech companies qualify without knowing it.*

**Video Script (45–60 sec):**
“Here’s the biggest myth about the R&D tax credit — that only biotech labs and scientists qualify. In reality, the IRS definition covers software development, prototyping, testing alternatives, solving uncertainty… basically the exact work tech teams do every day. Most founders think they *might* qualify — but in practice they almost always do. The real risk isn’t exploring eligibility. The real risk is leaving six-figures on the table because you assumed you didn’t qualify. If you’re building something that wasn’t guaranteed to work on day one… that’s R&D. We’ll tell you in 20 minutes exactly what you’re eligible for — no pressure, no commitment.”

## **2️⃣ “I don’t have time — this sounds like a huge admin burden.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
R&D claims are described as a “nightmare” and “pain” because of documentation and data gathering. 

**Belief to shift:**
*You don’t win by working harder — you win by automating evidence collection.*

**Video Script:**
“Most founders avoid the R&D credit because they think it means forms, documents, interviews with engineers, time logs… death by spreadsheets. That’s the old way. We flip it. Instead of doing a mad scramble at the end of the year, our platform captures the evidence in real-time from the tools your team already uses — GitHub, Jira, Notion, payroll, etc. Your engineers never touch paperwork. You don’t manage the system — the system manages the evidence. The fastest path to the credit isn’t more work — it’s zero work.”

---

## **3️⃣ “Audit risk freaks me out — I don’t want to poke the IRS.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
Finance leaders fear claims triggering audits, because the IRS scrutinizes R&D filings heavily. 

**Belief to shift:**
*Audit risk comes from poor documentation — not from maximizing credits.*

**Video Script:**
“Founders aren’t scared of getting money back from the government — they’re scared of the IRS knocking later. Fair. But here’s the truth: audits don’t come from claiming credit… they come from claiming credit without evidence. If you document the four-part test in real time, map payroll to QREs automatically, and store business component evidence from day one… then there’s nothing to fear. The companies that get audited are the ones trying to ‘wing it.’ We do the opposite — we make you exam-ready every single day. The safest credit is the one backed by bulletproof documentation.”

---

## **4️⃣ “I don’t want my engineers pulled into meetings and paperwork.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
They’ve heard horror stories about engineers having to write narratives and justify tasks manually. 

**Belief to shift:**
*Your technical team should never have to stop building to justify past work.*

**Video Script:**
“The fastest way to waste your team’s time is by asking engineers to explain what they did last year. So we just don’t. Instead, we read the output of tools they’re already using. Their normal workflow becomes the evidence — commits, tasks, prototypes, tickets. Zero added meetings. Zero reports. Zero ‘please explain this.’ If anything, engineers get *time back* because you remove a huge distraction from their year.”

---

## **5️⃣ “We already have someone handling R&D credits.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
Many already use consultants or CPAs and assume they’re getting the maximum value. 

**Belief to shift:**
*Consultants file claims — platforms maximize them.*

**Video Script:**
“When companies say ‘we already do our R&D credits,’ we ask one question: do you mean filing… or maximizing? Consultants do a once-a-year report. That misses 30–50% of what qualifies because documentation has to happen in real time — not 12 months later when no one remembers what happened. The difference between filing and maximizing is usually multiple six-figures per year. So feel free to keep your consultant if you love them — we’ll just make their job easy and multiply the amount they can submit.”

---

## **6️⃣ “I don’t trust consulting firms — too many horror stories.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
Reddit is full of warnings of “shady practices,” “overselling,” and “inflated claims.” 

**Belief to shift:**
*Transparency beats trust — automate the rules so nothing can be inflated.*

**Video Script:**
“People distrust the R&D credit space for one reason: they think consultants get paid to stretch reality. So we designed something where stretching isn’t possible. Our platform follows IRS rules precisely — four-part test, business component mapping, traceability, timestamped evidence. There’s no room for guesswork, no room for fictional hours, and no temptation to inflate anything. When the process is transparent and rule-based, trust just becomes the byproduct.”

---

## **7️⃣ “This sounds expensive.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
They’ve seen firms charging 15–25% of the credit and assume high cost. 

**Belief to shift:**
*The right solution pays for itself because it increases the credit amount — not just calculates it.*

**Video Script:**
“Pricing only matters when you’re not sure about ROI. Our system doesn’t just calculate — it increases your credit by finding activities and costs consultants usually miss. So the question isn’t ‘What does it cost?’ It’s ‘How much more do we get back?’ And here’s the kicker — with the success-based option, you pay nothing until you get your credit. It’s literally impossible to lose.”

---

## **8️⃣ “This sounds like a long onboarding — we’re busy.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
Their mental model is onboarding equals workflow change. 

**Belief to shift:**
*You don’t change your workflow — the evidence engine plugs into it.*

**Video Script:**
“The onboarding isn’t a transformation — it’s a connection. We plug into your systems, map your projects once, and you’re done. The average onboarding time: under 2 hours of your calendar. After that, the evidence is automatic — every sprint, every time entry, every experiment gets tracked without humans touching any paperwork. It’s not a project. It’s just switching on autopilot.”

---

## **9️⃣ “We’re still small — maybe we’ll do this later.”**

**Why they feel that way:**
Founders think R&D credits matter only when they’re scaling. 

**Belief to shift:**
*The earlier you start, the more money compounds — and missed credits can’t be recovered later.*

**Video Script:**
“Startups tell themselves they’ll claim R&D credits ‘once we’re bigger.’ Here’s the problem — you can only claim for past years if you had the right documentation in those years. If you wait, those dollars evaporate. And for early-stage companies, the payroll tax offset can return up to $500k per year. That’s hiring. That’s burn reduction. That’s runway. Waiting doesn’t save money — waiting loses money.”

---

## **🔟 “What if this doesn’t work for us?”**

**Why they feel that way:**
They’ve been burned by vendors with big promises before.

**Belief to shift:**
*Risk should sit with the provider — not the customer.*

**Video Script:**
“Here’s our point of view: you shouldn’t have to believe us — you should be protected from risk. That’s why you pay nothing until you receive your credit. And if your first-year credit isn’t at least 2× your subscription cost, we work free until it is. You don’t gamble on us — we gamble on ourselves.”
