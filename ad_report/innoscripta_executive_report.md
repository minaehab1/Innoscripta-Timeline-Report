# Innoscripta — Facebook & Instagram Ad Results

**Executive Summary | January 29 – February 25, 2026**

---

## The Big Picture

Over the past 4 weeks, we ran paid ads on Facebook and Instagram to generate leads for Innoscripta's R&D tax credit service in the US market. Here's what your ad budget delivered:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Total Ad Spend** | €2,690 over 28 days |
| **People Reached** | 46,027 unique US professionals |
| **Leads Captured** | 81 people who submitted their info |
| **Appointments Booked** | 9 meetings scheduled from ads |
| **Cost per Lead** | €33.22 |
| **Cost per Appointment** | €299.05 |

In simple terms: for every €33 spent on ads, one potential customer submitted their contact information. For every €299 spent, one meeting was booked with a qualified prospect.

## What's Working

We ran two campaigns during this period. Here's how they compare on what matters most — leads and booked appointments:

| Campaign | Spent | Leads | Appointments | Cost / Appt. |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| BB. Lead Campaign \| US \| 2026 | €1,660 | 43 | 5 | €332.00 |
| Primary Lead Gen \| CBO \| US | €1,026 | 38 | 4 | €256.47 |
| **Total** | **€2,690** | **81** | **9** | **€299.05** |

## Which Ads Are Performing

We tested several different ad creatives with different messages. Here are the results, ranked by how many leads each ad brought in:

| Ad Creative | Spent | Leads | Cost/Lead | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| €7.6 Million in Claims | €699 | 28 | €24.95 | ⭐ Winner |
| Stop Leaving Money on the Table | €638 | 24 | €26.60 | ⭐ Winner |
| Reddit-Style Video | €313 | 5 | €62.58 | Average |
| Track Your R&D (Control) | €23 | 3 | €7.63 | 🔍 Promising |
| Runway Ad (Georgia) | €50 | 2 | €24.84 | 🔍 Promising |
| 750K Claims Processed | €210 | 1 | €209.63 | ❌ Cut |
| €0/Month Risk-Free | €117 | 0 | N/A | ❌ Cut |
| Zero Hassle | €126 | 1 | €126.04 | ❌ Cut |

The two top-performing ads (€7.6 Million in Claims and Stop Leaving Money) together generated 52 of your 81 leads — that's 64% of all results. These are your proven winners.

The "Track Your R&D" ad is an early standout with a remarkably low cost per lead of just €7.63, but it has only had a small budget so far. It's worth testing with more money behind it.

Three ads are clearly not working and are wasting budget. We recommend turning them off immediately — that would free up roughly €450 in monthly spend to put behind the winners.

## Where We're Losing People

Here's the journey from someone seeing your ad to booking an appointment, and where people drop off along the way:

| Step | People | Drop-off | Conversion |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Saw the ad | 46,027 | — | — |
| 2. Clicked the ad | 3,219 | 93% left | 7% clicked |
| 3. Landed on website | 790 | **75% left** | 25% landed |
| 4. Submitted their info | 81 | 90% left | 10% converted |
| 5. Booked a meeting | 9 | 89% left | 11% booked |

The biggest leak is between steps 2 and 3: 75% of people who click the ad never actually make it to the website. This is unusual and could mean the website is loading too slowly, especially on mobile, or there's a disconnect between what the ad promises and what the landing page shows. Fixing this one issue could dramatically increase the number of leads without spending more on ads.

## What We Recommend Next

1. **Double down on what works.** Move budget from failing ads to the two winners (€7.6M Claims and Stop Leaving Money). These two ads alone could be generating 20–30% more leads if given more budget.

2. **Turn off the 3 underperformers immediately.** The "750K Claims," "€0/Month," and "Zero Hassle" ads have spent a combined €453 and produced only 2 leads total. That money is better spent elsewhere.

3. **Test the "Track R&D" ad with more budget.** At €7.63 per lead, this is showing 4x better efficiency than the account average. It's early, but the signal is strong enough to invest more and see if it holds up.

4. **Fix the website landing experience.** 3 out of 4 people who click the ad leave before the page loads. A faster, clearer landing page could potentially double or triple your leads at the same ad spend.

5. **Keep investing in Primary Lead Gen.** It's only been running for 2 weeks but is already delivering leads 30% cheaper than BB. Lead Campaign. Meta's algorithm is finding the right people.

## Bottom Line

Your ads are working. You're reaching senior decision-makers in the US and converting them into leads and meetings at a reasonable cost. The main opportunities are to cut waste from underperforming ads, scale what's already winning, and fix the website experience to capture more of the people who are already clicking.

If we fix the landing page drop-off and reallocate budget to top performers, we estimate we could increase leads by **40–60% without increasing overall spend**.
